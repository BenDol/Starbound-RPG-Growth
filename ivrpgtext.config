She knew he would not choose to depart, clutching on to life fruitlessly, spitting words of power at the emptiness surrounding: cursing this reality for snatching Zia from his grasp. So she would choose for him. There was no blood: there could not be; even so, he died. Glad, at first, her emotions turned sour: without a doubt, this was the only way. She knew it as such; the nothingness told her - not through whispers, not through images, not through thoughts, but through reality. The endless-featureless-emptiness was existence: the only definite, the only absolute, the only truth. Despite this, she could not help but feel overwhelmed as his soul escaped and only hers remained: ensnared, forever. The moment was gone: he had taken it from her, not via his own actions, but by hers. She panicked, as there was nearly nothing left for her to do.\n\nSoliste, she cried. Soliste! Was she waiting?

He could not accept that his apprentice would not be able to acquire his knowledge. He was, after all, the greatest teacher. The most intelligent scholar. The most impressive Warlock. It was, as he put it, an impossibility.\n\nThen that mission came. Experience was the best teacher, he said. So she came along, and unfortunately, or possibly not, she was erased. She did not die. No, because there was no death. Not with what they had found. She was the third one. Of course she was: because her master had been there all along, wielding magic greater than comprehension. But even so, she was erased...\n\nExcept she wasn't. That maniacal wizard had attempted something meta-universal. But you couldn't call that a success. No: she was livid. To be brought back because that man could not accept failure. Ridiculous. Ridiculous. Absolutely ridiculous. And just as he could not accept her 'death', she did not accept her 'return'. And maybe there was bitterness, and maybe there was fury, but she did not care. And with her newfound knowledge, she thought, perhaps she could do her own teaching.

But it gave her cover from the howling winds, pounding rain into the metal. She heard every drop. Flames lighting up the darkness, with occasional flashes from lightning outside, she cooked the beast, salivating. Another night.\n\nMorning came and she woke calmly, nudged gently by someone familiar. Normally, she would have noticed a presence much sooner, knife brandished, but with the Floran in front of her, it was rather difficult. The Floran smirked, before offering up a canteen. The nectarine water relieved her parched throat. Another morning.\n\nThe two continued along a tangled path, relying on her ears and eyes for guidance. Approaching the unknown entrance, they stopped to investigate - and summarily dismantle - the various contraptions meant to brutally dismember intruders. With the two of them quite astute and dextrous, it was child's play. The Ancient Tomb now exposed forever, the two searched inside, longing for an answer. Despite the Floran's perfect translations, the text was seemingly nonsensical, but not quite. Another clue.\n\nNow back in vicious wilderness, the two took shelter once more. Despite the situation, the Floran's hand grazed her neck. \"Will you help me recharge?\" The Floran teased: her actions set the context. \"Ha!\" The Hunter giggled. \"That's just like you. All alone for only three days and you're already like this.\" Even so, she reciprocated: Hunter or not, a little levity never hurt. Another day... a peaceful day."
