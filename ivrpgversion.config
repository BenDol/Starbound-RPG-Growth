    Caine's Chest:
        Thanks to my Patron, Caine, for requesting and helping design this awesome weapon.
        Caine's Chest is craftable via the Chest tab in the Industrial Workbench.
        It will function like a normal Chest, but leave it in the dark and you'll be met with a surprise. Be careful...
UI:
    Some items, such as Alloy Bars, now state that they are RPG Growth specific.
    Nova Status is now officially labeled Starfall.
Lore:
    New Lore Page added for RPG Growth Mechanics.
    Mechanics:
        This Lore tab will include explanations of in-game elements, such as status effects or new items.
        Currently only includes Statuses.
    Ret-conned Changeling lore to accurately describe Soliste and Winter.
Specializations:
    Hunter is now enabled.
    Unequipping Elementress's Tech now properly removes the Attune status.
    Dark Templar is still disabled while its Weapon is being created.
Known Bugs/Issues:
    Skill Points are not granted when leveling in a mech. Use the Skill Tab Reset Button to gain any missing points.
    When two or more Specialization Lore toasts should pop, only one does (all are still unlocked, however).
    Some Techs/Abilities Scripts generate Item Configs without a pcall, meaning that certain improper items may crash them.
    Elementress does not have a robust Tech description.
    Elementress's Tech, Attune, has difficult controls. A quality of life patch is in the works.
    Hunter does not have a robust Tech description.
