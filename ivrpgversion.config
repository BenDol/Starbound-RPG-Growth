    ^green;Caine
        Requested (and helped design) Caine's Chest, a Chest that turns into a weapon! Caine's Chest is craftable via the Chest tab in the Industrial Workbench. It will function like a normal Chest until left in pitch dark, where it will then become a weapon. Be careful... If you want to skip the steps to actually get the weapon, the ID is 'ivrpgwcaineschest'!
