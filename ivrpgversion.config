    Starting Items:
        For new players starting out, one Broken Wand, one Broken Dagger, and one Broken Pistol will be included in your Ship Locker. If you have already created a character before this update, you can spawn them in using the following item IDs:
            ivrpgwbrokenprotectoratewand
            ivrpgwbrokenprotectoratedagger
            ivrpgwbrokenprotectoratepistol
    Caine's Chest:
        Thanks to my Patron, Caine, for requesting and helping design this awesome weapon.
        Caine's Chest is craftable via the Chest tab in the Industrial Workbench.
        It will function like a normal Chest, but leave it in the dark and you'll be met with a surprise. Be careful...
Mechanics:
    Leveling up now also sates Hunger.
Skills:
    Skills are ordered alphabetically, rather than randomly.
Lore:
    Lore entries are ordered alphabetically, rather than randomly.
    Mechanics:
        New Mechanics tab added: Enemies.
        The Enemies tab will include information on new RPG unique monsters when added.
        The Enemies tab also indicates whether or not you have RPG AI installed, a new mod I've created to improve vanilla monsters a bit.
Specializations:
    Titan's Epimetheus' bullets now properly knockback enemies.
    Dark Templar is still disabled while its Weapon is being created.
Known Bugs/Issues:
    Skill Points are not granted when leveling in a mech. Use the Skill Tab Reset Button to gain any missing points.
    When two or more Specialization Lore toasts should pop, only one does (all are still unlocked, however).
    Some Techs/Abilities Scripts generate Item Configs without a pcall, meaning that certain improper items may crash them.
    Elementress does not have a robust Tech description.
    Elementress's Tech, Attune, has difficult controls. A quality of life patch is in the works.
    Hunter does not have a robust Tech description.
